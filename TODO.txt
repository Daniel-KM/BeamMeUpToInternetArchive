TODO for "Beam me up to Internet Archive" (plugin for Omeka)
============================================================

* Individual select for files of an item when editing item.
* Individual beam me up when editing file (currently only in main view).
* Beam builder (from Beam model).
* Curl object builder (or use Zend http?)?
* Beam as a mixin of item and file?
* Follow percent of progress when uploading records (via session).
* Add beams search filters for a better status view.
* Check https base url.
* Replace file_get_contents by curl (quicker and error management).
* Add an option to get all metadata for header.


Not to do
---------

* Save direct url to file in database [no: use /download/ path].
* Add a check for all files and items that haven't a matching beam
   (Currently, this is automatically done when displaying an item or a file).
   (Not to do because beams are created at any time).
